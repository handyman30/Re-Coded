# Deployment Instructions

## Important: API Routes Requirement

This website now includes API routes for form submissions (email functionality). This means the site can no longer be deployed as a static site. You'll need a hosting platform that supports server-side Next.js applications.

## Deploying to Netlify (Current Configuration)

The site is already configured for Netlify deployment with the Next.js runtime. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
   - Connect your repository to Netlify

2. **Environment Variables**:
   In Netlify Dashboard > Site Settings > Environment Variables, add:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_SwyVDDAp_D9LDWR8w7LoCV9TM3cyTaBC7
   RECIPIENT_EMAIL=your-test-email@gmail.com  # Optional: for testing
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   - Netlify will automatically detect Next.js and use the plugin
   - The `netlify.toml` file is already configured correctly

## Alternative Deployment Options:

### 1. Vercel (Easiest)
Vercel is built by the creators of Next.js:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### 2. Railway
- Supports Next.js with zero configuration
- Just connect repo and add env variables

### 3. Render
- Supports Next.js applications
- Simple deployment process

## Static Export (No Forms)

If you want to deploy as a static site (forms won't work), you can:
1. Re-enable static export in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
output: 'export',
```
2. Update `netlify.toml` to use `publish = "out"`
3. Remove or disable form functionality
4. Deploy to any static hosting

## Current Configuration

The site is currently configured for server-side deployment to support email functionality through the API routes.
