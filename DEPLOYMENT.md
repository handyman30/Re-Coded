# Deployment Instructions

## Important: API Routes Requirement

This website now includes API routes for form submissions (email functionality). This means the site can no longer be deployed as a static site. You'll need a hosting platform that supports server-side Next.js applications.

## Recommended Deployment Options:

### 1. Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel is the easiest option as it's built by the creators of Next.js:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Add environment variable: `RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key`
4. Deploy

### 2. Netlify with Next.js Plugin
To deploy on Netlify with API routes:
1. Install Netlify plugin: `npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs`
2. Update `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"
```
3. Add environment variable in Netlify dashboard: `RESEND_API_KEY`
4. Deploy

### 3. Other Platforms
- **Railway**: Supports Next.js with zero configuration
- **Render**: Supports Next.js applications
- **AWS Amplify**: Supports server-side Next.js

## Static Export (No Forms)

If you want to deploy as a static site (forms won't work), you can:
1. Re-enable static export in `next.config.js`:
```javascript
output: 'export',
```
2. Remove or disable form functionality
3. Deploy to any static hosting

## Environment Variables

Remember to add your `RESEND_API_KEY` to your hosting platform's environment variables for forms to work.

## Current Configuration

The site is currently configured for server-side deployment to support email functionality through the API routes.
